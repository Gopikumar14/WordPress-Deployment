Overview
This repository provides a complete guide for setting up an automated deployment process for your WordPress website using GitHub Actions and a Virtual Private Server (VPS). The process involves setting up a development environment, configuring the GitHub Actions workflow, and deploying the website to your VPS.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

A VPS instance with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
A domain name (optional, for custom domain configuration)
A GitHub account
Getting Started
Local Development
If you'd like to test changes locally before deploying, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary development tools (e.g., Git, Composer).
Configure your local development environment (e.g., PHP, MySQL).
Start your local development server (e.g., using PHP's built-in server).
Access the website in your browser (usually at http://localhost).
Automated Deployment
To deploy your website automatically to the VPS, follow these steps:

Push your changes to this repository.
GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the deployment workflow.
Monitor the workflow's progress and logs on the GitHub repository page.
Once the workflow completes successfully, access your WordPress website using the VPS's IP address or domain.
Configuration
GitHub Actions Workflow
The deployment workflow is configured in the .github/workflows/deploy.yml file. It performs the following steps:

Checks out the code from the repository.
Sets up SSH for secure communication.
Deploys the website files to the VPS using SCP.
Before using the workflow, ensure you have set up the necessary secrets in your GitHub repository settings. Refer to the GitHub documentation for more information on managing secrets.

Maintenance
Regular maintenance is essential to keep your WordPress website secure and up-to-date. Here are some tasks you should perform:

Periodically update the server's operating system, Nginx, MySQL, PHP, and WordPress to the latest versions.
Monitor server and website performance to ensure optimal response times.
Implement security best practices, including strong passwords and firewall configurations.
Keep backups of your website and database to recover from any unexpected issues.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during deployment, check the GitHub Actions workflow logs for error messages. You can also refer to the Troubleshooting guide for common solutions to known issues.
